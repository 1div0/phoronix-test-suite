	pts_external_dependencies_tandem_XmlReader.php: The XML reading object for the Phoronix Test Suite with optimizations for handling external dependencies

	Additional Notes: A very simple XML parser with a few extras... Does not currently support attributes on tags, etc.
	A work in progress. This was originally designed for just some select needs in the past. No XML validation is done with this parser, etc.
