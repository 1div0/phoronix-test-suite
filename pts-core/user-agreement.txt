Anonymous Usage Reporting / Statistics: If you opt to enable the anonymous usage reporting / statistics feature, some information about the Phoronix Test Suite runs will be submitted to Phoronix Global. This information is used for analytical purposes, including but not limited to, determining the most popular tests / suites and calculating average run-times for different test profiles. The test results are not reported in this process nor the installed software / hardware information, but just ambient information about the testing process. This information is stored anonymously. More information on this feature is available with the included documentation.
