A download cache is used for conserving time and bandwidth by eliminating the need for the Phoronix Test Suite to download files that have already been downloaded once. A download cache can also be transferred between PCs running the Phoronix Test Suite. For more information on this feature, view the included documentation. To generate a download cache, run:

phoronix-test-suite make-download-cache
