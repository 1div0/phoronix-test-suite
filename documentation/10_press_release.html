<h2>Phoronix Media Releases Linux-Based Testing Platform for Hardware, Software Validation</h2>
<p align="left"><em>With over 50 test profiles and 23 test suites, the Phoronix Test 
Suite offers unparalleled benchmarking for the Linux OS and can effectively gauge 
a computer's performance from video gaming to file encryption to audio-video encoding 
tasks.</em></p>
<p align="left">Grand Rapids, MI (<a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/linux_validation/linux_test_suite/prweb995384.htm">PRWEB</a>) 
June 5, 2008 -- Phoronix Media today released version 1.0 of the Phoronix Test 
Suite (codenamed &quot;Trondheim&quot;), an extensible open-source platform for 
conducting Linux-based benchmarking and performance profiling targeted at IHVs, 
ISVs, and technology hobbyists. The Phoronix Test Suite combines years of Linux 
testing by Phoronix Media with input from leading technology companies to offer 
the most comprehensive testing and benchmarking platform available for the Linux 
Operating System. The Phoronix Test Suite also offers unprecedented capabilities 
for collaboration via the suite's online component.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Over the past several years the Linux ecosystem has changed. 
For a large part it's now rare to find Linux incompatible hardware, but it's becoming 
a matter of having vendors optimize their drivers and ensuring a quality experience 
across a wide array of software. The Phoronix Test Suite looks to address this 
issue in part by providing a platform for conducting tests in an autonomous, reproducible, 
and standardized environment,&quot; said Michael Larabel, the founder of Phoronix 
Media and lead developer of the Phoronix Test Suite. &quot;The impact of the Phoronix 
Test Suite isn't limited to those interested in better optimizing their software 
or quality assurance teams ensuring device compatibility, but a by-product of 
this is greater vitality within the Linux ecosystem by fostering the growth of 
a standardized test specification.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">The Phoronix Test Suite was designed to be highly extensible. 
This software is provided under the GNU GPLv3 license to allow independent developers 
and companies to use this framework with the included tests, write test profiles 
for their own applications, or utilize third-party sources. A basic test profile 
can be written in a matter of minutes using the documented, standardized XML-based 
specification with support for installing the software, carrying out the programmed 
tests, and reporting the results. Through the turnkey deployment capabilities 
of the Phoronix Test Suite each test is run in a standardized, easy to use, and 
repeatable fashion on any Linux distribution and any system configuration.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;The overall flexibility and usability of the Phoronix Test 
Suite makes it easy to create complex testing configurations and still have the 
results presented in a readable and understandable fashion,&quot; said Andrew 
Schofield, a computational biologist and one of the contributing developers to 
the Phoronix Test Suite. &quot;Many of the software tools used in computational 
biology involve running tasks or analyses for extended periods of time due to 
the amount of computation required. Even a relatively simple molecular dynamics 
simulation can take a whole day of CPU time to only produce a couple nanoseconds 
of the simulation. The Phoronix Test Suite should be able to offer insight into 
what machine configurations perform the best at different tasks.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">For archiving, sharing, and analyzing results generated by the 
Phoronix Test Suite, an online component is provided free-of-charge and the results 
are web accessible. <a href="http://global.phoronix-test-suite.com/">PTS Global</a> 
supports searching through all uploaded results, grouping of results, side-by-side 
results comparison, uploading results with user-supplied tags, and other features 
to effectively analyze test results.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;The Phoronix Test Suite is an impressive, fast-developing 
general-purpose testing suite for both software and hardware on Linux...Its range 
and flexibility set it apart from the current batch of benchmarking tools,&quot; 
said Carla Schroder, author of The Linux Cookbook and The Linux Networking Cookbook. 
&quot;It has an especially interesting and useful feature that I believe is unique: 
a public repository for sharing and comparing test results, and replicating tests 
performed by other users. This is a great tool for system tuning and understanding 
what your own test results really mean. I think this is going to become one of 
the most popular and useful Linux benchmarking suites.&quot; </p>
<p align="left">The Phoronix Test Suite can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/">http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/</a>. 
Going forward, Phoronix Media will provide regular point releases with the next 
major update being planned for a Q4'08 release. Technical support can be made 
available to corporate customers on an individual basis.</p>
