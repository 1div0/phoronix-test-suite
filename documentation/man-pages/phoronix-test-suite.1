.SH NAME
phoronix-test-suite \- The Phoronix Test Suite is an extensible open-source platform for performing testing and performance evaluation. It supports benchmarking on Linux, OpenSolaris, BSD, and Mac OS X operating systems.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B phoronix-test-suite [options]
.br
.B phoronix-test-suite install [test | suite]
.br
.B phoronix-test-suite benchmark [test | suite]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Phoronix Test Suite is the most comprehensive testing and benchmarking platform available for the Linux operating system. This software is designed to effectively carry out both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks in a clean, reproducible, and easy-to-use manner. This software is based upon the extensive Linux benchmarking work and internal tools developed by Phoronix.com since 2004 along with input from leading tier-one computer hardware vendors. This software is open-source and licensed under the GNU GPLv3. The Phoronix Test Suite consists of a lightweight processing core (pts-core) with each benchmark consisting of an XML-based profile with related resource scripts. The process from the benchmark installation, to the actual benchmarking, to the parsing of important hardware and software components is heavily automated and completely repeatable, asking users only for confirmation of actions.
.PP
The Phoronix Test Suite can be used for simply comparing your computer's performance with your friends and co-workers or can also be used at your company for internal quality assurance purposes under Linux. Results from the Phoronix Test Suite are displayed in a results viewer with optional support for uploading them to Phoronix Global. Phoronix Global allows you to browse all uploaded results, search these results, and compare other results against your own system.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B install <To Install>
This option will install the selected test(s) inside the testing environment directory (defaults to ~/.phoronix-test-suite/installed-tests). The install process from downloading of the test files to the installation is fully automated. The install option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite as an argument. Optionally, a Phoronix Global ID or the name of a saved results file can be supplied as well and the test(s) to install will automatically be extracted from that information. If the test is already installed and was ran by the latest version of the installation process, no action will be taken.
.TP
.B benchmark <To Run>
This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed to run the test(s). This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with the install option followed by the run option. The name of the test or suite must be supplied or the Phoronix Global ID or saved local file name.
.TP
.B batch-benchmark <To Run>
This option and its arguments are equivalent to the benchmark option, but the process will be ran in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.
.TP
.B batch-setup
This option will prompt the user through the process of configuring the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.
.TP
.B list-tests
This option will list all available tests. The name, title, status, and license are displayed for each test.
.TP
.B list-suites
This option will list all available test suites. The name, title, and type are displayed for each suite.
.TP
.B merge-results <To Merge> <To Merge>
This option will manually merge multiple sets of test results generated by the Phoronix Test Suite. For the arguments, the name of the test or suite must be supplied or the Phoronix Global ID or saved local file name. As of Phoronix Test Suite 1.8, more than two arguments can be specified to merge many sets of test results.
.B reference-comparison <Saved Result>
This option will allow you to compare your test results to available reference system results on supported test profiles and suites.
.B info <To Show>
This option will show details about the test or suite that's supplied as the first argument to this option. When supplying the name of a test, the version, maintainer, type, download size, license information, and suites using this test are displayed. When supplying the name of a suite, the version, maintainer, type, and tests that make up the suite are displayed.
.TP
.B login
This option allows you to log-in to your Phoronix Global account and will store this information automatically. A new Phoronix Global account can be created (for free) at http://global.phoronix-test-suite.com/.
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.B gui <To Install>
This option will launch the GTK user interface for the Phoronix Test Suite. The PHP GTK module is required for this interface.
.TP
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B $ phoronix-test-suite benchmark universe
This command will install (if needed) and then proceed to run all tests within the universe suite.
.TP
.B $ phoronix-test-suite install openssl
This command will install (if needed) the OpenSSL test.
.TP
.B $ phoronix-test-suite benchmark build-linux-kernel
This command will install (if needed) and then proceed to run the build-linux-kernel test.
.TP
.B $ MONITOR=all phoronix-test-suite benchmark universe
This command will install (if needed) and then proceed to run all tests within the universe suite, while recording/monitoring available system sensors. The sensor results are then shown at the end of the test.
