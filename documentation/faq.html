<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<div style="width: 1px; height: 20px;"></div>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em> Why does the Phoronix Test Suite not use my distribution's 
package management system for acquiring all needed packages?</strong></p>
<p><em>A:</em> The tests themselves are generally downloaded from source and built 
locally on the machine, rather than fetching any distribution-specific packages. 
This is done to ensure more comparable results across operating systems / releases, 
etc. The distribution packager could be applying a number of unknown patches to 
the software, building the software with unique build options, or making other 
changes to the software that could skew the results.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em> Besides being a developer, documentation writer, or having 
any other unique technical abilities, how else can I contribute to the Phoronix 
Test Suite?</strong></p>
<p><em>A:</em> At <a href="http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/">Phoronix-Test-Suite.com</a> 
we do accept donations / tips :). We also appreciate any feedback, comments, or 
other ideas either by emailing us, posting on the forums, or sending a message 
to the mailing list.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em> Do you offer technical support for the Phoronix Test Suite</strong></p>
<p><em>A:</em> Paid, professional support is available and is currently done on 
an individual basis. For more information, <a href="http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/?k=contact">contact 
us</a>. Free, community support is offered via our mailing list and forums.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em> May I use the Phoronix Test Suite when running benchmarks 
for my own publication, blog? Are there any publishing restrictions?</strong></p>
<p><em>A:</em> You are more than welcome to use the Phoronix Test Suite for your 
own publication. In fact, we invite you to do so! All we would ask in return is 
that you kindly consider linking to <a href="http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/">www.phoronix-test-suite.com</a> 
within the article so that your readers will know where to obtain the software 
if they are interested in running the tests themselves. You are also more than 
welcome to upload your results to <a href="http://global.phoronix.com/">Phoronix 
Global</a> so that others may compare their results against yours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em> May I put the Phoronix Test Suite logo on my company's 
web-site or on my product packaging?</strong></p>
<p><em>A:</em> <a href="http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/?k=contact">Contact 
us</a> for licensing information and details regarding the Phoronix Certification 
&amp; Qualification Suite.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em> How often is the Phoronix Test Suite updated?</strong></p>
<p><em>A:</em> We provide major updates on a quarterly basis with an occasional 
point release to fix outstanding bugs, add new profiles, or address other issues. 
The latest work going into the Phoronix Test Suite is accessible via our Git repository 
at <a href="http://www.phorogit.com/">Phorogit.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em> Does the Phoronix Test Suite run on Windows?</strong></p>
<p><em>A:</em> Right now the operating systems officially supported by the Phoronix 
Test Suite are Linux, Mac OS X, OpenSolaris, and the BSDs. The Phoronix Test Suite 
right now is not compatible with Windows. However, the Phoronix Test Suite could 
be made to run on Windows 7 by porting over pts-core / Phodevi and some other 
parts of the software. Not all of the test profiles would be windows compatible 
either, but some of them would be. However, due to a lack of access to Windows 
systems and other factors, none of this work is currently on going. If your company 
or organization is interested in financing this work, contact us.</p>
