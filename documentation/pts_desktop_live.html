<h1>PTS Desktop Live</h1>
<div style="width: 1px; height: 20px;"></div>
<p align="left">PTS Desktop Live is a Linux distribution designed to provide a 
free software platform for carrying out system tests and hardware benchmarks in 
an automated, reproducible, and effective manner. PTS Desktop Live is designed 
around the <a href="http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/">Phoronix Test Suite</a> 
with the operating system itself consisting of a stripped down Linux environment, 
then built upon that is the Phoronix Test Suite with its test profiles and suites. 
This distribution is not a standard Linux desktop with the normal throng of packages. 
Testing with PTS Desktop Live is intended to be via a Live DVD or Live USB (i.e. 
flash drive or memory card) environment. PTS Desktop Live makes it very easy to 
deploy the Phoronix Test Suite across an array of systems, isolates any software 
differences when seeking to perform hardware comparisons, and is designed to be 
very easy to carry out these Linux benchmarks even for a first-time Linux user.</p>
<p align="left">The inaugural release of this operating system is PTS Desktop 
Live 2009.3 (codenamed &quot;Gernlinden&quot;) and is combined with Phoronix Test 
Suite 2.0. The Gernlinden release ships with more than 50 open-source test profiles 
and with all needed files being located on the disc image. PTS Desktop Live uses 
the GTK2 GUI dialog for the Phoronix Test Suite by default, but the CLI options 
are also accessible. This initial 2009.3 release should be considered a beta or 
technology preview release with there still being some &quot;rough edges&quot; 
to this build when it comes to some minor details, customizations, and extra test-related 
features, but this will all be enhanced in forthcoming releases. Future releases 
of this distribution will also contain greater work when it comes to optimizing 
the Linux kernel and related components for use on the latest high-end hardware 
and other performance related tweaking. There are also some features accessible 
through the command-line version of the Phoronix Test Suite that are not yet implemented 
from the GUI, but that too will be addressed in future releases.</p>
<p align="left">The mission of PTS Desktop Live and the Phoronix Test Suite will 
not be achieved until it has made Linux benchmarking incredibly robust and innovative, 
drop dead easy to perform nearly any kind of benchmark, and when it outpaces other 
leading operating systems for its benchmarking abilities. PTS Desktop Live is 
being updated quarterly in conjunction with new Phoronix Test Suite releases. 
The Phoronix Test Suite will continue to be supported under all other Linux distributions, 
OpenSolaris, Mac OS X, and *BSD operating systems, but PTS Desktop Live is just 
another addition on top of that.</p>
<p align="left">PTS Desktop Live is designed to run on x86_64 compatible systems 
with 2GB or more of system memory (ideally 4GB if you wish to run many of the 
tests in a live environment) being highly recommended along with a modern CPU 
and graphics processor. No proprietary graphics drivers are shipped with PTS Desktop 
Live at this time, so depending upon the hardware you may not have OpenGL acceleration 
to run the few graphics-related tests that are included with this release. An 
Internet connection is not required but is needed for communication with Phoronix 
Global and for utilizing some of the other Phoronix Test Suite features.</p>

<p align="left"><em>With PTS Desktop Live 2009.3 being the initial release of 
this Linux operating system, at <a href="http://www.phoronix-media.com/">Phoronix 
Media</a> we are certainly looking for feedback on this release. We have many 
new features and other improvements under development for future releases of PTS 
Desktop Live and the Phoronix Test Suite, but we would appreciate hearing any 
success stories with this software, feedback on areas you would like to see improvements, 
and other capabilities you would like to see encompassed. Please share this information 
with us via <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=49">our 
forum</a>, <a href="http://phoronix-test-suite.com/mailman/listinfo/trondheim-pts_phoronix-test-suite.com">our 
mailing list</a>, or by <a href="http://www.phoronix-media.com/?k=contact">contacting

<h1 align="left">Quick Start Guide</h1>
<p align="left">When PTS Desktop Live has fully booted, the end-user agreement 
for the Phoronix Test Suite will be displayed, followed by initializing the main 
GTK2 user interface for the Phoronix Test Suite. The Phoronix Test Suite has more 
than 100 test profiles while there are about 50 test profiles featured within 
PTS Desktop Live, which are free software, do not pose significant install size 
problems, and are suitable for benchmarking from a live environment. By default, 
PTS Desktop Live will only show the test profiles and suites where all of the 
needed test files and dependencies ship with this open-source operating system. 
However, to access any of the test profiles that may require downloading additional 
files or external dependencies, use the <em>View</em> menu to toggle the different 
options. The system's hardware and software information can also be viewed in 
a graphical window from this menu.</p>
<p align="left">From the <em>Available Tests</em> tab, any test/suite can be selected 
to view more information. If you wish to install the test, simply click on the 
install button while waiting shortly for it to install. Afterwards, the test can 
be run by selecting it again and clicking on the run/benchmark button. If you 
have a <a href="http://global.phoronix.com/">Phoronix Global</a> account, you 
can login from the <em>File</em> menu while Phoronix Test Suite settings are adjustable 
from the <em>Edit</em> menu.</p>
<p align="left">When the testing has completed, the graphical user interface will 
reappear. Via the buttons that appear at the top of the interface, the test results 
can then be opened within the web browser. Depending upon the test profile, it 
may also be possible to immediately compare the test result(s) against a set of 
reference systems. If the completed test(s) do have reference results available, 
a list of the comparable systems are shown, so that you can click on one or more 
of these reference systems to see how the given system performs in comparison. 
Results from Phoronix Global can also be compared with any of the test results.</p>
<p align="left">Assuming you did not launch any commands from the terminal to 
alter the disk(s) or its contents or carry out any other changes; PTS Desktop 
Live will have not touched your data or the installed operating system(s). If 
you wish to archive any of your test results, upload the results to <a href="http://global.phoronix.com/">Phoronix 
Global</a>. Alternatively, when going to the <em>Test Results</em> tab and selecting 
a test, the <em>File</em> menu presents options for exporting results to text, 
CSV, and PDF files. The contents of the <em>~/.phoronix-test-suite/test-results/</em> 
folder can also be backed up for preserving the test results.</p>
