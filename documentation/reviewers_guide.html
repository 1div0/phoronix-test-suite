<p>While the Phoronix Test Suite came out of our internal test tools for carrying out Linux hardware reviews at <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix.com</a>, we invite other hardware review web-sites, technology journals, and independent publications to use our software too. In fact, we welcome it. You can find some of the other publications using our testing software in <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?t=12925">this forum thread</a>. While not required, we would just kindly ask that you mention in your review/article that the <em>Phoronix Test Suite</em> was used for carrying out your testing, and ideally to link to <a href="http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/">www.phoronix-test-suite.com</a> so that interested readers can use the software for themselves to compare their results against the ones you publish. To make this even better for your readers, you could upload your results to <a href="http://global.phoronix.com/">Phoronix Global</a> to facilitate easy test comparisons by your readers.</p>
<p>We also try to make the Phoronix Test Suite easy-to-use by independent publications. For example, if you would like to watermark your web-site's URL into the graphs containing your test results, that can be easily modified in <em>~/.phoronix-test-suite/graph-config.xml</em>. The colors and other graph settings are also stored in this XML file. If you are a publication and run into any issues with the Phoronix Test Suite or have a feature request, please let us know.</p>
