<h1>System Sensor Monitoring</h1>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite supports monitoring system sensors to look at trends 
and provide other benefits. The Phoronix Test Suite will automatically monitor 
the selected sensors while each test is running and at the end will then provide 
the low and high thresholds for each sensor as well as the average. In addition, 
the sensor results are then plotted on line graphs and can be viewed through the 
PTS Results Viewer. This sensor detection and monitoring is done through <a href="http://www.lm-sensors.org/">LM_Sensors</a> 
and ACPI interfaces. The GPU sensor monitoring is done through proprietary ATI 
and NVIDIA extensions.</p>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite is capable of measuring the GPU temperature, CPU temperature, 
system temperature, battery power consumption, CPU voltage, +3.33V line voltage, 
+5.00V line voltage, and +12.00V line voltage. Additional sensors will be supported 
in the future.</p>
<p>The full list of supported sensor options can be found by running <em>phoronix-test-suite 
sensor-options</em>. The sensors actually detected on the current system and their 
values can be read by running <em>phoronix-test-suite sensors</em>. Selecting 
sensors to monitor is performed through the <em>MONITOR</em> environmental variable. 
As examples, to monitor just the CPU temperature while running the universe suite, 
one would run <em>MONITOR=cpu.temp phoronix-test-suite benchmark universe</em>. 
To monitor all sensors while running the Nexuiz game, one would run <em>MONITOR=all 
phoronix-test-suite benchmark nexuiz</em>. To monitor the temperature and voltage 
of the CPU, run <em>MONITOR=cpu.temp,cpu.voltage phoronix-test-suite benchmark 
universe</em>. This feature works no matter the suite or test being run.</p>
<p>ACPI will automatically be used if it's supported on the system and LM_Sensors 
will be used if it has previously been installed and configured (by running <em>sensors-detect</em> 
as root).</p>
<p>Once the test(s) are completed, the sensor statistics are printed to the standard 
output and the user is prompted to view the results with the PTS Results Viewer 
in their web browser. The sensor graphs are saved to their default location of 
<em>~/.phoronix-test-suite/system-monitor/</em>. At this time, sensor results 
are not uploadable to PTS Global.</p>
