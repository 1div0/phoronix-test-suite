<h1>Phoronix Test Suite Options</h1>
<h2>Test Installation Options</h2> 
<p><strong>install &lt;To Install&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will install the selected test(s) inside the testing environment 
directory (defaults to ~/.phoronix-test-suite/installed-tests). The install process 
from downloading of the test files to the installation is fully automated. The 
install option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite as an argument. 
Optionally, a Phoronix Global ID or the name of a saved results file can be supplied 
as well and the test(s) to install will automatically be extracted from that information. 
If the test is already installed and was run by the latest version of the installation 
process, no action will be taken. Multiple arguments can be supplied to install additional tests at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>install-all</strong></p>
<p>This option will install all available test(s) inside the testing environment 
directory (defaults to ~/.phoronix-test-suite/installed-tests). The install process 
from downloading of the test files to the installation is fully automated. As of Phoronix Test Suite 1.6 this option 
has been deprecated. Users should instead use <em>install all</em>.</p>
<p><strong>force-install &lt;To Install&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will force the installation (or re-installation) of a test or suite. 
The arguments and process is similar to the install option but even if the test 
is installed, the entire installation process will automatically be executed. 
This option should only be used when debugging a test installation problem.</p>
<p><strong>force-install-all</strong></p>
<p>This option will force the installation (or re-installation) of all tests. 
The process is similar to the install-all option but even if a test is installed, 
the entire installation process will automatically be executed. This option should 
only be used when debugging a test installation problem. As of Phoronix Test Suite 1.6 this option 
has been deprecated. Users should instead use <em>force-install all</em>.</p>
<h2>Run Options</h2>
<p><strong>benchmark &lt;To Run&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed 
to run the test(s). This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with 
the install option followed by the run option. The name of the test or suite must 
be supplied or the Phoronix Global ID or saved local file name. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results in a suite-like fashion.</p>
<p><strong>default-benchmark &lt;To Run&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed 
to run the test(s) in the defaults mode. This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with 
the install option followed by the default-run option. The name of the test or suite must 
be supplied or the Phoronix Global ID or saved local file name. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results in a suite-like fashion.</p>
<p><strong>run &lt;To Run&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will run the selected test(s). The name of the test or suite must 
be supplied or the Phoronix Global ID or saved local file name. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results in a suite-like fashion.</p>
<p><strong>default-run &lt;To Run&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will run the selected test(s). The name of the test or suite must 
be supplied or the Phoronix Global ID or saved local file name. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results in a suite-like fashion. 
Unlike the normal <em>run</em> option, the <em>default-run</em> will not prompt the user to select from the available test options but will instead use the default options as automatically set by pts-core or the test profile. Use <em>batch-run</em> to automatically test all of the available options.</p>
<p><strong>finish-run &lt;Saved Results File&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option can be used if a test run had not properly finished running all tests within a saved results file. Using this option when specifying a saved results file where all tests had not completed will attempt to finish testing on the remaining tests where there are missing results.</p>
<p><strong>estimate-run-time &lt;To Run&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will attempt to estimate how much time is needed to run the specified test, suite, Phoronix Global test, or saved results file. The estimated time for each individual test is displayed along with the overall time required. These time estimates are based upon the average run-time for previous test runs and/or estimates specified within the test profile(s).</p>
<h2>Batch Run Options</h2>
<p><strong>batch-setup</strong></p>
<p>This option is used to configure the batch mode options for the Phoronix Test 
Suite, which is subsequently written to the user configuration file. Among the 
options are whether to automatically upload the test results to Phoronix Global and 
prompting for the saved file name.</p>
<p><strong>batch-run &lt;To Run&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option and its arguments are equivalent to the run option, but the process 
will be run in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.</p>
<p><strong>batch-benchmark &lt;To Run&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option and its arguments are equivalent to the benchmark option, but the 
process will be run in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.</p>
<h2>Test Dependency Options</h1>
<p><strong>install-dependencies &lt;To Install&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will install the external dependencies needed by the selected test(s) 
using the distribution's package management system. For example, some tests depend 
upon GCC for compiling code. If GCC is not detected on the system, the Phoronix 
Test Suite will attempt to install GCC using the distribution's package management 
system. If you're running this command as a local user, you may be prompted for 
the root password while the process is running. For unsupported distributions, 
the dependency names will be displayed along with common names for the package. 
The install-dependencies option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite 
as an argument. Optionally, a Phoronix Global ID or the name of a saved results file 
can be supplied as well and the external dependencies will automatically be extracted 
from that information. The install-dependencies option will only install the dependencies 
on tests that utilize this feature. When using the install option, the external 
dependencies are automatically checked.</p>
<p><strong>list-possible-dependencies</strong></p>
<p>This option will list all possible external dependencies used by tests within the Phoronix Test Suite.</p>
<p><strong>list-installed-dependencies</strong></p>
<p>This option will list all external dependencies used by tests within the Phoronix Test Suite that are installed on the system.</p>
<p><strong>list-missing-dependencies</strong></p>
<p>This option will list all external dependencies used by tests within the Phoronix Test Suite that are not installed or missing from the system.</p>
<h2>Test Options</h2>
<p><strong>list-tests</strong></p>
<p>This option will list all available tests. The name, title, status, and license 
are displayed for each test. Tests that aren't supported on the system due to architecture or 
platform limitations aren't listed.</p>
<p><strong>list-all-tests</strong></p>
<p>This option is like <em>list-tests</em> but will also lists tests that are marked of an EXPERIMENTAL, 
PRIVATE, BROKEN, or UNVERIFIED state. The name, title, status, and license 
are displayed for each test.</p>
<p><strong>list-suites</strong></p>
<p>This option will list all available test suites. The name, title, and type 
are displayed for each suite.</p>
<p><strong>list-installed-tests</strong></p>
<p>This option will list all tests that have been installed by the Phoronix Test 
Suite.</p>
<p><strong>list-installed-suites</strong></p>
<p>This option will list all suites where all of the contained tests have been installed by the Phoronix Test 
Suite.</p>
<p><strong>list-test-usage</strong></p>
<p>This option is similar to list-installed-tests with showing the tests that are installed, 
but it will also show the date/time a test was installed, when the test was last run, and the 
number of times the test was run by the Phoronix Test Suite.</p>
<p><strong>info &lt;To Show&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will show details about the test or suite that's supplied as the 
first argument to this option. When supplying the name of a test, the version, 
maintainer, type, download size, license information, and suites using this test 
are displayed. When supplying the name of a suite, the version, maintainer, type, 
and tests that make up the suite are displayed.</p>
<h2>GUI Options</h2>
<p><strong>gui</strong></p>
<p>This option will launch the GTK user interface for the Phoronix Test Suite. The PHP GTK module is required for this interface.</p>
<h2>Result Viewing Options</h2>
<p><strong>list-results</strong></p>
<p>This option will list all saved results. The file name, title, test(s) performed, 
and result identifiers are displayed.</p>
<p><strong>result-info &lt;To Show&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will show basic information about a test result file such as the contained tests 
and test result identifiers.</p>
<p><strong>show-result &lt;To Show&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will show the test results of the selected file (set as the first 
argument) in the default web browser.</p>
<p><strong>remove-result &lt;To Remove&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will permanently remove the saved file reset that is set as the 
first argument.</p>
<p><strong>remove-all-results</strong></p>
<p>This option will permanently remove all saved results.</p>
<p><strong>remove-installed-test &lt;To Remove&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will permanently remove a installed test by the Phoronix Test Suite.</p>
<p><strong>merge-results &lt;To Merge&gt; &lt;To Merge&gt; &lt;To Save As&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will manually merge multiple sets of test results generated by the Phoronix Test Suite. 
For the arguments, the name of the test or suite must be supplied or the Phoronix Global ID or saved 
local file name. As of Phoronix Test Suite 1.8, more than two arguments can be specified to merge 
many sets of test results.</p>
<p><strong>extract-from-result-file &lt;Saved Result&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will extract a single set of test results from a saved results file that contains multiple test results that have been merged. The user 
is the prompted to specify a new result file name and select which result identifier to extract.</p>
<p><strong>reference-comparison &lt;Saved Result&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will allow you to compare your test results to available reference system results on supported test profiles and suites.</p>
<p><strong>result-file-to-pdf &lt;Saved Name&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will read a saved test results file and save a copy of it as an Adobe PDF 
file for easy distribution. The system details are written to the PDF file along with JPEG versions of all graphs 
and related information.</p>
<p><strong>result-file-to-text &lt;Saved Name&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will read a saved test results file and output the system hardware and software information to the terminal. The test results are also 
outputted to the screen.</p>
<p><strong>result-file-to-csv &lt;Saved Name&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will read a saved test results file and output the system hardware and software information along with the results to a CSV output. The CSV 
(Comma Separated Values) output can then be loaded into a spreadsheet for easy viewing.</p>
<h2>Phoronix Global Options</h2>
<p><strong>upload-results &lt;To Upload&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option allows you to upload a saved result to Phoronix Global.</p>
<p><strong>clone &lt;Phoronix Global ID&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will download a local copy of a file that was saved to Phoronix Global, 
as long as a valid Phoronix Global ID is supplied.</p>
<p><strong>login</strong></p>
<p>This option allows you to log-in to your Phoronix Global account and will store 
this information automatically. A new Phoronix Global account can be created (for free) 
at http://global.phoronix-test-suite.com/.</p>
<h2>Analytical Options</h2>
<p><strong>analyze-batch &lt;Saved Name&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will analyze a batch results file and plot out the performance impact 
from the different options onto a line graph (i.e. to see the impact that changing the video 
resolution has on the system's performance).</p>
<p><strong>analyze-all-runs &lt;Saved Name&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will generate a candlestick graph showing the distribution of results from all trial runs. The 
candlestick graph is similar to the Japanese candlestick charts used by the financial industry, except instead of representing 
stock data it's numerical result data from all trial runs.</p>
<p>The tip of the upper-wick represents the highest value of the test runs with the tip of the lower-wick representing the lowest value of 
all test runs. The upper-edge of the candle body represents the first or last run value and the lower-edge represents the first or last run value. 
Lastly, if the last run value is less than the first run value, the candle body is the same color as the graph background, otherwise the last run value 
is greater.</p>
<h2>Module Options</h2>
<p><strong>list-modules</strong></p>
<p>This option will list all modules that are installed / present in the <em>pts-core/modules/</em> directory. 
Modules are used for extending the functionality of the Phoronix Test Suite without over-inflating the pts-core.</p>
<p><strong>module-info &lt;Module Name&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will show detailed information on a PTS module such as the version, developer, and a description of its purpose.</p>
<p><strong>module-setup &lt;Module Name&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will allow you to configure all available end-user options for a PTS module. These options are then stored within the user's 
configuration file. Not all modules may have options that can be configured by the end-user. These options are then stored in 
<em>~/.phoronix-test-suite/modules-config.xml</em> and modules can access them using the <em>pts_module::read_option()</em> function.</p>
<h2>Test/Suite Creation</h2>
<p><strong>build-suite</strong></p>
<p>This option will guide the user through the process of generating their own test suite, which they can then run.</p>
<p><strong>result-file-to-suite &lt;Saved Name&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will guide the user through the process of generating their own test suite, which they can then run, that's based upon an 
existing test results file.</p>
<p><strong>validate-test-profile &lt;Test&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will run automated checks on a Phoronix Test Suite test profile in an effort to catch common errors or warnings with the test profile, 
such as missing XML tags or other issues.</p>
<p><strong>validate-test-suite &lt;Suite&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will run automated checks on a Phoronix Test Suite test suite in an effort to catch common errors or warnings with the test suite, 
such as missing XML tags or other issues.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous Options</h2>
<p><strong>make-download-cache</strong></p>
<p>This option will backup all files that were automatically downloaded by the 
Phoronix Test Suite during the installation of tests. These files are automatically 
backed up by default to ~/.phoronix-test-suite/download-cache/. By backing up 
these files, one can easily transfer these files to another system running the 
Phoronix Test Suite thereby conserving bandwidth and reducing time. Through modifying 
the user configuration file, the download cache location can be adjusted. The 
Phoronix Test Suite supports reading from download caches over the network and 
on remote file-systems.</p>
<p><strong>download-test-files &lt;Test or Suite&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will download all needed files for a specified test or suite, but it will not install the test(s).</p>
<p><strong>system-info</strong></p>
<p>This option will show installed system hardware and software that has been 
detected by the Phoronix Test Suite.</p>
<p><strong>diagnostics</strong></p>
<p>This option will print information that is useful to developers when debugging 
problems with the Phoronix Test Suite.</p>
<p><strong>version</strong></p>
<p>This option will print the Phoronix Test Suite version.</p>
<p><strong>refresh-graphs &lt;Saved Name&gt;</strong></p>
<p>This option will re-render and save all result graphs within a saved file. 
This option can be used when making modifications to the graphing code or its 
color/option configuration file and testing the changes.</p>
<p><strong>initial-config</strong></p>
<p>This option will generate a new user configuration (user-config.xml) file.</p>
<p><strong>user-config-set</strong></p>
<p>This command will set new option value(s) for user configuration options stored in 
<em>~/.phoronix-test-suite/user-config.xml</em>. The tag name must be specified followed by an equal sign 
and then the new value. Example: <em>phoronix-test-suite user-config-set CacheDirectory=~/cache/</em> to set a new cache directory for the Phoronix Test SUite.</p>
