<h1>Phoronix Test Suite Installation</h1>
<p>A majority of the Phoronix Test Suite development and testing are done on Ubuntu and Fedora Linux, but this testing software should run virtually unmodified on any Linux distribution. The only distribution-specific bits deal with the external dependencies support feature. For instance, if you're not running one of the supported distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mandriva, CentOS) you may need to install a package manually in order for a test to run. For example, the OpenGL Utility Toolkit may need to be installed manually by the user to support the OpenGL source tests.</p>
<h2>Running Locally</h2>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite can be simply extracted from the downloaded <em>.tar.gz</em> 
file or it can also be installed system-wide. If you just wish to run the Phoronix 
Test Suite without installing it, open a terminal and run <em>./phoronix-test-suite 
&lt;options&gt;</em> from the same directory.</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>The only required dependencies for the Phoronix Test Suite on Linux systems 
are PHP 5.x CLI (packages for it are commonly called <em>php5-cli</em> or <em>php-cli</em> 
or just <em>php</em>) and the PHP GD module (commonly called <em>php-gd</em> or 
<em>php5-gd</em>). It's important to note that only PHP 5 is needed and not a 
web server (Apache) or other packages commonly associated with PHP. The reasoning 
behind the use of PHP 5 for is the portability across platforms for this language, 
low impact on the overall system, a lower entrance barrier for new developers, 
and low number (if any) dependencies that PHP5 CLI requires. The PHP GD library 
is used for rendering the graphs within the PTS Results Viewer.</p>
<p>Note #1: Depending upon your distribution's package configuration, you may also need <em>php-posix</em> package for providing the POSIX functions.</p>
<p>Note #2: You may need to modify the <em>php.ini</em> file on your system in order to support uploading results to PTS Global or logging into your PTS Global account. The <em>allow_url_fopen</em>, <em>file_uploads</em>, and <em>allow_url_include</em> options must be set to true in the PHP configuration and curl must be supported by the PHP installation. <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/forums/showpost.php?p=32484&postcount=4">Additional information</a>.
<p>While PHP and PHP GD are the only required dependencies, many of the test profiles 
do require the standard Linux development tools/libraries (GCC, etc). On a clean 
Ubuntu installation, it's as easy as first running <em>sudo apt-get install build-essential 
php5-cli php-gd</em> and then running the Phoronix Test Suite. In addition, <em>/usr/bin/time</em> 
is another dependency used by many of the tests.</p>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite has a feature known as &quot;External Dependencies&quot; 
where the Phoronix Test Suite can attempt to automatically install some of the 
test-specific dependencies on supported distributions. If running on a distribution 
where there is currently no External Dependencies profile, the needed package(s) 
are listed. To see all possible External Dependencies, run <em>phoronix-test-suite list-possible-dependencies</em>.</p>
<h2>File Structure</h2>
<p>If manually changing the location of the phoronix-test-suite file, the environmental 
<em>PTS_USER_DIR</em> variable must be adjusted inside the file to reflect the 
absolute location that leads to the root directory of the <em>pts</em> and <em>pts-core</em> 
folders. The <em>pts</em> folder houses the XML test profiles, XML test suites, 
test resource files, the External Dependencies files, and other important information. 
The <em>pts-core</em> directory is the &quot;engine&quot; of the Phoronix Test 
Suite.</p>
<h2>Generic Installation</h2>
<p>Running install-sh from the root directory of the Phoronix Test Suite will 
install the software for system-wide access. By default the <em>phoronix-test-suite</em> 
executable is in <em>/usr/bin/</em>, the Phoronix Test Suite files in <em>/usr/share/phoronix-test-suite/</em>, 
and the documentation in /<em>usr/share/doc/phoronix-test-suite/</em>. Root access 
is required. The default installation prefix is /usr/ but can be adjusted as the 
first argument (example: install-sh /home/user-name/ to install the Phoronix Test 
Suite in your home directory).</p>
<h2>Debian/Ubuntu Installation</h2>
<p>Debian/Ubuntu users are able to follow the Generic Installation instructions 
or optionally can generate their own Debian package. If <em>dpkg-dev</em> is installed, 
run <em>php pts-core/scripts/build-package-deb.php</em> and a Debian package will 
be generated which can be subsequently installed. This package contains the <em>phoronix-test-suite</em> 
executable in /usr/bin/, the Phoronix Test Suite files in <em>/usr/share/phoronix-test-suite/</em>, 
and the documentation in <em>/usr/share/doc/phoronix-test-suite/</em>.</p>
<h2>Gentoo Installation</h2>
<p>Gentoo ebuild's for the Phoronix Test Suite have been created by users and can be currently found in the <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216656">Gentoo BugZilla</a>.</p>
<h2>Mandriva Installation</h2>
<p>Mandriva packages are being worked on by Stephane Teletchea and are expected for inclusion in Mandriva Linux 2009 development.</p>
