The Phoronix Test Suite is the most comprehensive testing and benchmarking platform available for Linux and is designed to carry out qualitative and quantitative benchmarks in a clean, reproducible, and easy-to-use manner. This software ships with over 30 test profiles and 12 test suites, but new custom tests can be easily added by writing an XML-based test profile. For more information on the Phoronix Test Suite and its possibilities, check out: http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/.
