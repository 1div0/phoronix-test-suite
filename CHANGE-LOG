PHORONIX TEST SUITE CHANGE-LOG

Phoronix Test Suite

- Add support so distribution vendors / package mantainers can create their own defaults for user configuration options as a template at /pts/etc/user-config-template.xml
- Clean up all of the *_LOCATION defintions to using *_DIR
- Support test profiles to write their installation scripts in PHP instead of just SH. If using php, name the file install.php
- Allow test profiles to have pre.php and post.php process scripts, in addition to pre.sh and post.sh
- Support multiple possible paths in "PossiblePaths" in test profiles, with each path delimited by a colon
- Support if binary is named php5 instead of php
- Add IgnoreFirstRun argument for test profiles
- Add support for a test profile to have a downloads.xml file inside their resources folder that contains all of the files that need to be downloaded. Phoronix Test Suite then handles the downloading internally as well as verifying the MD5 sums, downloading from a random URL if multiple URLs are specified, etc. Some other features will come about soon for those using downloads.xml for acquiring all needed files
- Drop bcdiv/bcmath dependency for pts_Graph, switch to internal function for trimming doubles
- Add 7-Zip compression test (compress-7zip)

- Some code cleaning
- Improved CPU detection support, especially for multi-processor multi-core environments
- Improved GPU and related detections support... Now can read the anti-aliasing and anistropic filtering levels for NVIDIA graphics cards as well as the core temperature
- Add MONITOR= environmental variable. If MONITOR=gpu.temp, the low, average, and high temperatures will be reported at end of test
- Add a lot more sensor and monitoring support... Add MONITOR=sys.temp and MONITOR=cpu.temp. Multiple sensors supported that are delimited by comma (depends upon LM_Sensors)
- Clean up pts-results-viewer as well as switching to Liberation Sans for the font in graph rendering and clean up graph alignment
- Add remove-all-results option
- Add in espeak text-to-speech engine test
- Add in multicore suite of SMP-friendly tests
- Add force-install option for installing benchmarks already installed
- Add line graphing support of monitor results
- Basic CPU and system temperature monitoring support through ACPI, if LM_Sensors is not installed and/or reporting information
- Improved thermal monitoring support
- Improvements to pts-grapher with alignment
- Add version argument for showing PTS version and code-name
- Have a pts-monitor-viewer with basic functionality working. Prompt to open pts-monitor-viewer in web browser, if MONITOR results were recorded
- Add basic auto-tagging support for PTS Global if no tags are supplied
- Immediate detection when attempting to a run a test to see whether or not it's installed. If it's not, let the user know what to do and exit
- Report to test notes if Intel EIST or AMD Cool n Quiet / PowerNOW or another CPU power-savings/frequency-scaling technology was in use
- Report to test notes if the system was running on battery power
- End-User agreement shows when Phoronix Test Suite runs for the first time or when the agreement has been modified

- Test results location now defaults to ~/.phoronix-test-suite/test-results/ and saved benchmarks now defaults to ~/.phoronix-test-suite/installed-tests/

- Many "External Dependencies" improvements. Needs testing and more distribution profiles!
- Add "install-dependencies pts" for installing some PTS dependencies for itself, aside from php-cli.
- Introduce Fedora support for External Dependencies. Only tested with Fedora 8.92.
- Shutdown screensaver when running phoronix-test-suite. Currently only GNOME screensaver is supported with detection through GConf. If that doesn't work, then xdg-screensaver reset is ran before each test is executed.
