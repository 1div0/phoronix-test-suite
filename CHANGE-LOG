This file is optional and contains checks to verify whether the test is PROPERLY installed and setup (read: all set for benchmark) or whether it still needs to be installed. If the test is properly setup, it should just output TRUE, otherwise the test will be reinstalled.
- Setup PTS_TEMP_DIR (defaults to /tmp/phoronix-test-suite/) as temporary working directory
- When downloading test files, first download to the PTS_TEMP_DIR and perform all verification in this area. Only move file to the test environment directory once the file is verified. Addresses issues of PTS thinking file is verified if user closes window prematurely.
- Add support for DownloadSize and EnvironmentSize inside the test profile's TestProfile tag for the estimated size of the files to be downloaded and the estimated size of the setup test environment directory. These tags are optional and if supplied the value must be in megabytes. (Easy help but would be much appreciated: Filling this information in for the existing test profiles)
- Add in detection code if DownloadSize and EnvironmentSize are supplied, if the free space in the respective directories aren't large enough, quit.
- Create a basic tree view of all tests/suites contained inside a suite when running suite-info <suite-name>
- Add a generic (very basic) install script for installation (named install-sh). Defaults to /usr/ but if first argument is supplied it will over-ride to that location
- A number of test profile updates
- Advanced merging capability
- Add SupportedArchitectures tag to TestProfile, if the test is only compatible with select architectures (delimit each architecture by a comma)
- With list-tests option, don't show tests that are of status PRIVATE or EXPERIMENTAL
- Code optimizations
- Add result quantifier option for parsing results... For traditional numerical profiles, the ResultQuantifier tag can have values of MAX and MIN for recording the maximum or minimum values. Other modes can be supported in the future. For numerical results where the tag isn't supplied, it will default to AVG.
