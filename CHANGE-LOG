- Pts-Grapher updates
- Other fixes

Phoronix Test Suite 0.2.1
April 12, 2008

Phoronix Test Suite 0.2.0
April 6, 2008

- Prompt to auto upload results after test completion
- Improved hardware detection. Unrecognized components will now show as "Unknown" instead of generating error
- Merge results now creates the test results folder and copies pts-results-viewer, if the folder wasn't previously created
- Drop the use of bcdiv() (diverted into custom code) so users don't need the php-bcmath module.
- Introduce Bandwidth profile as a new system memory and Level 2 cache benchmark
- Strip "Processor" from the reported CPU output area as it's redundant
- Improve "RAMspeed" profile. Fix so that results can be saved. Add option whether to record Add, Copy, Save, Triad, or Average. Bump to v0.2.
- Introduce "system-memory" test suite. Tests RAM performance using RAMspeed and Bandwidth (currently).
- Clean up text output a bit. Add "arguments description" string to text output when showing final results for each test.
- Improved CPU detection / ensures the frequency is shown. Properly handles the frequency for those overclocking or with power-savings technologies.
- Added video memory detection support. Defaults to 128MB. Video memory capacity (in MB) exported to VIDEO_MEMORY for profiles.
- Compatibility checks when merging results
- Improved video card detection (use GL renderer and use lspci now only for fallback)
- Add Super PI profile (Thanks to Pekka Panula)
- Compress-gzip update (Thanks to Kano)
- Other updated scripts (Thanks to Kano)
- Doom 3 profile now working
- Improved distribution detection
- New results viewer (work in progress)
- Other small fixes

Phoronix Test Suite 0.1.0

- Initial public release! (April 2, 2008)

Phoronix Test Suite 0.0.9

- phoronix-test-suite list-tests now displays the profile's status and the license type of software
- Drop pts-core/pts-results-viewer/text.gif
- Fix 0.0.8 regression as the zero fix caused no results to be saved
- Allow "upload" argument to use relative/absolute path instead of just the save name

Phoronix Test Suite 0.0.8

- Save result even if the value is zero
- Fix merge-results bug when using global ID(s)

Phoronix Test Suite 0.0.7

- Support for benchmark <Global ID> for extracting all arguments from that test.
- Support for benchmark <Local File> for extracting all arguments from that test.
- Change list-benchmarks to list-tests
- A number of end-user input checks and errors if arguments are missing
- Various bug fixes in path to 0.1

Phoronix Test Suite 0.0.6

- Nexuiz 2.4 Profile
- Added ImageMagick Build Profile
- Add Linux Kernel (2.6.25) Build Profile
- Add Universe Profile (universe). The Universe profile is made up of all Phoronix Test Suite benchmark profiles in a maintained state.
- Fix compress-gzip profile so results are actually outputted
- Added Enemy Territory: Quake Wars demo profile... currently seems to hang on start
- Added (optional) PreRunMessage to benchmarking profiles at PTSBenchmark/Information/PreRunMessage. This just displays a string of information (such as a warning or benchmark limitation) and then when the user hits any key the benchmark will continue.
- Hdparm profile script now uses gksu (TODO: support other *su)
- EnvironmentDirectory in user-config.xml now requires an absolute location. Defaults to ~/pts-benchmark-env.
- Fix list-saved-tests so that it will actually list the saved tests.
- Introduce pts_save_result. Checks for SAVE_RESULTS_LOCATION and makes it if it doesn't exist and copies over the XSL, CSS, and JavaScript to SAVE_RESULTS_LOCATION/pts-results/viewer for the results viewer.
- Use profile-check on the global database for checking whether Global ID is valid remotely, instead of attempting fetch directly.
- Fix bug where if you entered an invalid benchmark/suite name, it would ask if you wanted to save the results before realizing it didn't exist.

Phoronix Test Suite 0.0.5

- Code cleaning
- More improvements with Phoronix Test Suite Global Database

Phoronix Test Suite 0.0.4-1
