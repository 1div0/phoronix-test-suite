PHORONIX TEST SUITE EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE-LOG

Phoronix Test Suite

- pts-core: Change test/suite type strings to define statements
- pts-core: Add test type caching support
- pts-core: Create the unified PTS test/suite type handler
- pts-core: Clean-up some test installation functions
- pts-core: Provide new architecture for test/suite checking through the type handler
- pts-core: Drop PTS_USER_DIR usage
- pts-core: Add support for having tests and suites stored locally within ~/.phoronix-test-suite/ as an option for users installing new tests/suites or third-party files
- pts-core: Add support so that a test profile can extend another test, for Cascading Test Profile support. This is similar to inheritance in programming languages or Cascading Style Sheets.

- pts-core: A test profile isn't real: likely incomplete or just a base test within a Self-Contained Test Profile extension
- pts-core: Report identifiers of test profiles being extended to the test profiles being run
- pts-core: Drop PTS shared download support for test profiles, instead they should be using the Cascading Test Profiles functionality
- pts: Switch all audio encoding tests to extend a timed-audio-encode base test instead of all tests having some of the same code copied throughout
- pts: Switch all build tests to extend a timed-build base test instead of all tests having some of the same code copied throughout
- pts: Switch all video tests to extend a video-sample base test instead of all tests having some of the same code copied throughout
- tandem_Xml: Add a pts_test_tandem_XmlReader object that extends tandem_XmlReader but takes advantage of the handleXmlZeroTagFallback
- tandem_Xml: Add fallback function handler support when a tag isn't found
- documentation: Add basic documentation concerning the Self-Contained Test Profiles (SCTP) XML tags that are added
