PHORONIX TEST SUITE EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE-LOG

Phoronix Test Suite 1.4.0 Alpha 1
September 18, 2008

- pts-core: Change test/suite type strings to define statements
- pts-core: Add test type caching support
- pts-core: Create the unified PTS test/suite type handler
- pts-core: Clean-up some test installation functions
- pts-core: Provide new architecture for test/suite checking through the type handler
- pts-core: Drop PTS_USER_DIR usage
- pts-core: Add support for having tests and suites stored locally within ~/.phoronix-test-suite/ as an option for users installing new tests/suites or third-party files
- pts-core: Add support so that a test profile can extend another test, for Cascading Test Profile support. This is similar to inheritance in programming languages or Cascading Style Sheets.
- pts-core: Add in support for Self-Contained Test Profiles (SCTP) that initiate the Phoronix Test Suite and runs a stand-alone test
- pts-core: A test profile isn't real: likely incomplete or just a base test within a Self-Contained Test Profile extension
- pts-core: Report identifiers of test profiles being extended to the test profiles being run
- pts-core: Drop PTS shared download support for test profiles, instead they should be using the Cascading Test Profiles functionality
- pts-core: Don't allow the user to save a test result file if it's the same name as a real test profile or test suite
- pts-core: Add Mac OS X operating system detection support (using the IS_MACOSX define)
- pts-core: Improve VirtualBox virtualization detection for guest operating systems running
- pts-core: Add $COMPILER and $VIDEO_DRIVER user variables when saving the results and supplying the test identifier
- pts-core: Let the size of files being downloaded be specified individually within the test's downloads.xml profile instead of a generic one through the test profile XML file
- pts-core: When downloading files for tests, don't first download the file to the PTS temporary directory, but just rename it initially within the test's environment directory
- pts-core: When running a test (or suite that contains a test) on an unsupported architecture or platform, don't abruptly exit
- pts-core: Add module_setup() to pts_module_interface for returning an array of objects that can be configured by the end-user
- pts-core: Add support for persistent configuration options that end-users can easily adjust for PTS modules by running "phoronix-test-suite module-setup MODULE-NAME" that are stored to ~/.phoronix-test-suite/modules-config.xml
- pts-core: Add pts_module::set_option() function to allow a module itself to set a persistent configuration option
- pts-core: Add PTS_QUIT module return type for having the Phoronix Test Suite stop immediately and prematurely (this should only be used in the event of reaching a fatal bug or other problem)
- pts-core: Have the Phoronix Test Suite check once a day to see if the version in use is the latest version, otherwise inform the user of an available update
- pts-core: Add fall-back support for reading the PCI subsystem vendor if the motherboard vendor can't be determined using the other HAL information
- pts-core: Add a PreInstallMessage tag for test profiles that will be shown to the user prior to installing the test
- pts-core: Don't have PreRunMessage or PreInstallMessage hang when in batch mode
- pts-core: pts_find_file() -> pts_find_result_file()
- pts-core: Add initial support for detecting the motherboard Southbridge where applicable
- pts-core: Omit OEM in read_hal()
- pts-core: With list-tests, don't list tests that aren't compliant with the running system's architecture and platform
- pts-core: Add support so test options can be set as an environment variable by using <TEST NAME UPPER_CASE>_<NUM OPTION>=<INDEX OF REQUEST>
- pts-core: Switch to using php_uname() in pts-init.php
- pts-core: Add support for reading all ATI forced anti-aliasing types: Box, Narrow-tent, Wide-tent, and Edge-detect
- pts: Switch all audio encoding tests to extend a timed-audio-encode base test instead of all tests having some of the same code copied throughout
- pts: Switch all build tests to extend a timed-build base test instead of all tests having some of the same code copied throughout
- pts: Switch all video tests to extend a video-sample base test instead of all tests having some of the same code copied throughout
- pts: Change all current and relevant test profiles shipping the Phoronix Test Suite to using the FileSize tags within their downloads.xml files
- pts: Improve the reported environment size for many of the test profiles
- pts: Update compress-7zip test profile to use p7zip 4.58
- pts: Add World of Padman test profile (named padman)
- pts: Add padman to ioquake3-games test suite
- pts: Update Mandriva Linux packages XML file (Thanks To Stéphane Téletchéa)
- tandem_Xml: Add a pts_test_tandem_XmlReader object that extends tandem_XmlReader but takes advantage of the handleXmlZeroTagFallback
- tandem_Xml: Add fallback function handler support when a tag isn't found
- graphics_event_checker: Add graphics_event_checker module that makes sure the graphics system isn't messed up or having unintended options enabled while tests are running
- graphics_event_checker: Merge the gpu_error_counter module functionality into the graphics_event_checker module
- timed_screenshot: A module that takes a screenshot while tests are running at a pre-defined interval
- documentation: Add basic documentation concerning the Self-Contained Test Profiles (SCTP) XML tags that are added
