- Implement PTS modules support
- Move sensor monitoring support from pts-core to a new module called system_monitor
- Add list-modules option for listing all available/installed modules
- Add module-info option for viewing information on a module
- Drop pts-functions_monitor.php now that it's all modulized.
- Drop PTS_MONITOR_DIR environmental variable and pts_save_user_file() function from pts-core
- Add pts_module object for providing some common functions to use by PTS modules
- system_monitor: Poll sensors every 30 seconds during testing
- Add CPU usage monitoring support to pts-core
- system_monitor: Add cpu.usage to MONITOR, fix some bugs as well
- pts_LineGraph: Don't display the pointers if there are too many points on the graph
- pts_Graph: Always show key/legend if it's a single-type line graph
- pts_Graph: Use image antialiasing if it's available on the system
- pts_module: If pcntl isn't present, don't thread and warn the user
- system_monitor: Add gpu.freq to MONITOR
- Fixes for PTS results merging and recording of arguments
- Clear up test file versus unique identifier / test run text
- Add graphics_override module for having FORCE_AA and FORCE_AF options for overriding anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering levels with supported drivers
- Allow support for loading modules manually by setting each module name in the PTS_MODULES environmental variable and separating multiple modules via comma
- Add Extensions tag to results file
- tandem_Xml: Add a caching engine to the XML parsing/reading portion
- tandem_Xml: Add setFileCaching(), setTagCaching(), and setCaching() options
- Add ProjectURL tag to available test profiles
- Introduce a test installation management system and this replaces the previous pts-install management solution. New setup is XML based and monitors time a test was installed, last time a test was run, number of times a test was run by PTS, and this pts-install.xml system will be used for some future features.
- With info option, when a test is specified, let the user know whether it's installed. If it's installed, print the last time the test was executed and the total number of times it was executed.
- Change location of results directory tag within the user-config.xml configuration
- Change location of the user agreement check-sum tag within the user-config.xml configuration
- Add LoadModules tag to user-config.xml with support for loading modules every time upon running PTS
- Change BENCHMARK_ENV_DIR to TEST_ENV_DIR definition
- pts_test_type() now returns TEST instead of BENCHMARK
- Change DOWNLOAD_CACHE environmental variable to PTS_DOWNLOAD_CACHE for manual override of the download cache location
- Add operating system detection support
- pts-core: Time-zone used is now set to UTC
- Add support for OpenSolaris 2008.05 operating system
- Add verbose system hardware detail logging support
- pts-core: Improve text layout of test option prompts
- pts-run-benchmark: General code cleanups
